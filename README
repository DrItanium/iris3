Iris3 is a research project to see what it is like to have a language based
computer like a LISP machine. Interestingly enough the language I'm using is
CLIPS which is a lisp language. The difference is that CLIPS is a language for
writing expert systems so that will be interesting to translate.

The primary language of iris3 is LISP but there is an underlying
microarchitecture that will be very much in flux.
